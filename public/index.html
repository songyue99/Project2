      <h2>ü•≤ Many dialects are dying in China </h2>
      <p>
        Many places in the world, including China, are witnessing the rapid disappearance of dialects - along with the
        disappearance rich cultures behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dialects fade away due to many reasons: the formalization of one language (or only a few) in a nation, the need
        to communicate in an easy and mutually-understandable language throughout globalization, and the widespread use
        of technology (which is heavily based on the one single standard language). Dialects carry not only the
        linguistic value of diversity but also the rich cultures in the local areas. It's extremely difficult to
        describe or document local cultural events or rituals without dialects. People also tend to cherish a lot the
        memories buried in them!

      <h2>ü§Ø So how might we save the dialects?</h2>

      <p>
        One of the effective ways to pass along dialects is to use them online: on social media, give it meanings and
        make sound documentations.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a successful online campaign to revive a Danish dialect in 2015, which used a combination of sound
        annotations and memes. It demonstrated the great power that technology can play in saving dialects in the modern
        world, instead of destroying them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cantonese speakers also successfully invented sounds annotations to talk to each other online even though it is
        only recognized as an official spoken language in Hongkong, Macau, and the Guangzhou Province.
      </p>

      <h2>üèÜ Here is the game!</h2>

      <p>
        For my Connections Lab final project @IMA Low Res, I made this meme-guessing game, which utilizes dialect
        pinyin(a way of denoting sounds and tones with English characters) as the main connection method. Through the
        fun process, I wish to remind people of their intimate relationship with dialects and encourage them to use
        dialect more online!
